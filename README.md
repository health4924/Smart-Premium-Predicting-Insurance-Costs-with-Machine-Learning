# Smart-Premium-Predicting-Insurance-Costs-with-Machine-Learning
SmartPremium is a machine learning project to predict insurance costs based on customer data. It includes EDA, feature engineering, regression modeling, ML pipelines, and MLflow tracking — offering a complete workflow from raw data to accurate premium prediction.
# SmartPremium: Predicting Insurance Costs with Machine Learning 

Welcome to SmartPremium — a simple yet powerful project that shows how machine learning can help predict insurance premium costs more accurately. If you've ever wondered how data can be used to make smarter business decisions in the insurance world, you're in the right place!

# What’s this project about?

This project takes real-world insurance data and uses machine learning to estimate how much a customer’s insurance might cost. We dive into the full process — from understanding the data to building a model, and even creating a user-friendly web app.

# What’s inside?

Here's what this project includes:
- A full walkthrough of data cleaning and exploration (EDA)
- Smart feature engineering for both numbers and categories
- A regression model to predict insurance costs
- Model tracking with MLflow
- A simple Streamlit app to interact with the model

# Tech & Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data handling)
- **Scikit-learn** (for modeling)
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (for visualizations)
- **MLflow** (for experiment tracking)
- **Streamlit** (to build the interactive app)
